## Session 1

### Practice for 000_minimal_frame.py script:

- Make some instruction text appear 6 seconds before the stimulus presentation for 5 seconds.
- Change squares into circles, and place them vertically.
- Make the color of the squares controllable by deciding on red, green, blue (RGB) values.
- **Bonus** : Change the squares into rotating grayscale Gabor patches.

### Practice for 001_minimal_frame_temporal_separation.py script:
- Create a circular hole in the center of the squares.
- Make the edges of the squares appear smoothed.

### Practice for 002a_minimal_frame_modulus.py script

- Make the loop of the stimuli progressively faster.
- Reduce the number of stimuli to 2 (black and white squares) and make the looping (flickering) of the stimuli controllable by a variable which takes a value in Hertz.
- **Bonus** : Make the stimuli drift from left to right. The motion should happen between the start and end of the stimulus presentation.
- **Bonus+** : Make two squares drift from left to right in sinusoidal paths, they should move anti-phase to each other.

___

### Practice for 002b_minimal_frame_protocol.py script
- Randomize the appearance of the order the stimuli.
- **Bonus** : Randomize the appearance of the order the stimuli and their corresponding durations.
- Make this script start presenting stimuli only after a key press.
- **Bonus** : Make sure that the protocol starts and ends with correct timings after the start key press.

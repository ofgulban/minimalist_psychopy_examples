## Session 1

### Practice for 000_minimal_frame.py script:

- Make some instruction text appear 6 seconds before the stimulus presentation for 5 seconds.
- Change squares into circles, and place them vertically.
- Make the color of the squares controllable by deciding on red, green, blue (RGB) values.
- Change the squares into black and white gratings.
- **Bonus** : Change the squares into rotating grayscale Gabor patches.

### Practice for 001_minimal_frame_temporal_separation.py script:
- Create a circular hole in the center of the squares.
- Make the edges of the squares appear smoothed.

### Practice for 002a_minimal_frame_modulus.py script

- Make the loops of the stimuli progressively faster. For example 3 loops, each one cycles faster than the previous loop.
- Reduce the number of stimuli to 2 (black and white squares) and make the looping (flickering) of the stimuli controllable by a variable which takes a value in Hertz.
- **Bonus** : Make the stimuli drift from left to right. The motion should happen between the start and end of the stimulus presentation even when the total time is changed by the user.
- **Bonus+** : Make two squares drift from left to right in sinusoidal paths, they should move anti-phase to each other.

## Session 2

### Practice for 003a_minimal_frame_protocol.py script
- Randomize the appearance of the order the stimuli.
- Make this script start presenting stimuli only after a key press.
- **Bonus** : Randomize the appearance of the order the stimuli and their corresponding durations.
- **Bonus** : Make sure that the protocol starts and ends with correct timings after the start key press.

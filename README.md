### General

These are some very simple [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) scripts that I have written for demonstrating some basics to people who did not have much programming experience. It seems that they are useful so I have decided to put them here for easy access.

The scripts are ordered in a way that they start from very simple and get more and more feature rich.

This repository in an ongoing project so expect some changes to happen in time.

More resources are available in the official site following [this link](http://www.psychopy.org/resources/resources.html). I would also recommend to check the demos in Psychopy [coder view](http://www.psychopy.org/coder/coder.html).

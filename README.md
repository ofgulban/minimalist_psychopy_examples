These are some very simple [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) scripts that I have written to show some basics to people who did not have any experience.

From the feedback I have got, it seems like they are useful. So I have decided to put them here for easy access.

You can can do whatever you want with the scripts. They are [unlicensed](LICENSE).

You can find more resources in the official site following [this link](http://www.psychopy.org/resources/resources.html).

These are some very simple [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org/) scripts that I have written for demonstrating some basics to people who did not have much programming experience.

It seems that they are useful so I have decided to put them here for easy access.

More resources are in the official site following [this link](http://www.psychopy.org/resources/resources.html).

You can can do whatever you want with these scripts. They are [unlicensed](LICENSE).
